# [12503 Robot Instructions](http://uva.onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&category=24&page=show_problem&problem=3947)


## Easy Problem

Keep in mind:
- Origin is always 0.
- Have to memorise the previous states of instraction.
- If LEFT: move one unit left (decrease pos by 1, where pos is the position of the robot before moving)
- If RIGHT: move one unit right (increase pos by 1)
- If SAME AS i: perform the same action as in the i-th instruction.

That's it.

Happy programming :)
