# [10323 Factorial! You Must be Kidding!!!](http://uva.onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&category=24&page=show_problem&problem=1264)


## Easy Problem 

  1. Overflow! (When n! > 6227020800)
  2. Underflow! (When n! < 10000)
  3. Otherwise print n!

You can see that 8! to 13! are the third condition. And n<8 is the 1st and n>13 is 2nd condition.

So, we can precalculate the value of 8!,9!,10!,11!,12! and 13!.Then compare with the condition.

That's it.
