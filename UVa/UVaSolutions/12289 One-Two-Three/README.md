## Easy Problem

Only three words and in every word can have at most one wrong letter. But word length is always correct.

Three words are:
> one, two and three

So, if the intpute word's length is equal 5 ,then the word will be __three__.
Otherwise we have to check whether it is __one__ or __two__.

That's simple enough.
