## Easy Problem

This is some thing like cartesia co-ordinate system.

Just have to determine the possition according to the problem description.

- the word `divisa' (means border in Portuguese) if the residence is on one of the border lines
(North-South or East-West);
- `NO' (means NW in Portuguese) if the residence is in Northwestern Nlogonia;
- `NE' if the residence is in Northeastern Nlogonia;
- `SE' if the residence is in Southeastern Nlogonia;
- `SO' (means SW in Portuguese) if the residence is in Southwestern Nlogonia.
