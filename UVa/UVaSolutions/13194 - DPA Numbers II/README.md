# [13194 - DPA Numbers II](https://uva.onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&page=show_problem&problem=5105)

## Number Theory Problem

In this problem input begins with an integer ``` t (1 <= t <= 1100)```, the number of test cases, followed by t lines, each line
containing an integer ```n (2 <= n <= 1012)```.
Here ```n``` is the number we have to choose the category of it as a ```deficient```, ```perfect``` or ```abundant``` number.

So the to calculate the prime factor of an integer is a big deal.
Therefore I've used [sieve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes).

Please find details in prolem discription and c++ code.

### Welcome back
Happy programming :)
