The problem was supper easy!!! But you have to know some physics law. Say a particle has initial velocity ```u``` and acceleration ```a```.
If its velocity after certain time ```t``` is ```v``` then we have to calculate its
displacement ```s``` be in twice of that time ```2*t```.

Let's apply physics law which we have learnt at High School!
```
    We know that,
            v = u + at 
         So, a = (v-u)/t ..........(1)
            s = ut + (at^2)/2 .....(2)
            
         Here, time = 2*t
         
         Now, 
            from equations (1) & (2):
               s = 2ut + 2vt - 2ut
            => s  = 2vt ...........(3)
            
         Equation (3) is our solution!!
    
```
Yes you have done!


Thats all in time :)
