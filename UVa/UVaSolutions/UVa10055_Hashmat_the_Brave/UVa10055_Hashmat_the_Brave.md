## Editorial
The problem was supper easy!!! But there was a problem in storing data in variable of maximum size ```4294967296```.
Therefore I used ```unsigned long long int``` which was more than enough.

I had failed many times solving this easy problem.

My lesson from this problem is getting input of ```unsigned long long int``` number and also printing that number.
Something like ```scanf("%llu%llu",&i,&j)``` and ```printf("%llu\n",(i-j))```.

Thats all in time :)
