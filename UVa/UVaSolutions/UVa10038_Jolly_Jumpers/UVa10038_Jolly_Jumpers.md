The problem was supper easy!!! But you have to figure out what is ```jolly jumper```.

__Jolly jumper__ : A sequence of ```n>0 integers``` is called a jolly jumper if the absolute values of the difference between
successive elements take on all the values ```1 through n-1```. The definition implies
that ```any sequence of a single integer``` is a jolly jumper.

That means, if n=1 then it is jolly jumper by definition. And "if the absolute values of the difference between
successive elements take on all the values 1 through n-1" means that no need sequentially ```1,2,3...,n-1``` or ```n-1,...3,2,1``` etc. but it have to contain all values 1 through n-1.

Thats all in time :)
