# [UVa 119 - Greedy Gift Givers](https://uva.onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&category=3&page=show_problem&problem=55)

## Editorial
The problem was easy but need some care about presenting output. ```The output for each group should be separated from other groups by a blank line.``` But ```mind it "no extra blank line have in the last line of last output group!!```.
I did some mistake something like that and therefore got ```presentation error!!!```.

I used a function named ```update``` which update the current amount of money after giving or receiving money.

You should also care about the input something like ```vick 0 0```, which mean the gift-givers-person doesn't give money and there have no receiver. Or something like ```person 123 0```.

Thats all in time :)
